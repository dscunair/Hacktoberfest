## Description

"Google Go" redirects here. For the Android search app by Google, "Google Go", for low-end Lollipop+ devices, see Android Go. For the computer program by Google to play the board game Go, see AlphaGo.
Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google[14] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[12] Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[6] and CSP-style concurrency.[15] The language is often referred to as Golang because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.[16]
There are two major implementations:

Google's self-hosting[17] compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices,[18] and WebAssembly.[19]
gccgo, a GCC frontend.[20][21]
A third-party transpiler GopherJS[22] compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.
